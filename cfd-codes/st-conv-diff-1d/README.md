# CFD Project n+01: Solution of stationary convection-diffusion equation

In this project, the solution of a one-dimensional stationary convection-diffusion equation was developed and programmed using the C programming languge.

A bullet-point description of the project:
- solves the 1D stationary convection-diffusion problem;
- uses the finite-difference approach;
- both upwind difference and central difference schemes were used;
- both uniform and non-uniform meshes were used;
- the program was fully implemented in C;
- results were analysed with a script written in Python.
